# PHP Script to send mail with reCaptcha v2

Here is a repo of all the files I used to create a form submission in PHP aswell as implementing reCaptcha v2

    <script src="https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api.js" async defer></script>
```

[A guide that helped me was this](http://acmeextension.com/integrate-google-recaptcha-with-php/)
